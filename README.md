# Fanblocker - Fandom Disruption Blocker

Fanblocker is a fan-made [Firefox](https://firefox.com) extension that removes the header, sidebar, and side rail of a [Fandom](https://fandom.com)'s wiki allowing a smooth reading experience.

Fanblocker **does not** remove advertisements. For this I recommend [uBlock Origin for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) made by [Raymond Hill](https://github.com/gorhill).

## Preview
